<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Tri-Dung Nguyen</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Trid</strong>, pronounced as <em>/trÉªd/</em> (rhyming with "rid" or "grid"). I'm a mobile engineer with over six years of experience in Android development and more than a year working with Flutter. Throughout my career, I've built and optimized various mobile applications, tackling challenges in performance, architecture, and user experience.</p>

<p>I created this blog as a space to document my learning journey, share insights, and keep track of important topics in software development. While working on mobile applications, I frequently encounter new concepts, best practices, and interesting challenges. Writing about them helps solidify my understanding and, hopefully, benefits others in the community as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Deep dives into mobile development (Android &amp; Flutter)</li>
<li>Notes on best practices, architecture, and performance optimization</li>
<li>Insights from real-world projects and problem-solving experiences</li>
<li>Thoughts on industry trends and new technologies</li>

</ul>
