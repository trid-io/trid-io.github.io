## Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Tri-Dung Nguyen**, but you can call me **Trid**, pronounced as */trÉªd/* (rhyming with "rid" or "grid"). I'm a mobile engineer with over six years of experience in Android development and more than a year working with Flutter. Throughout my career, I've built and optimized various mobile applications, tackling challenges in performance, architecture, and user experience.

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog as a space to document my learning journey, share insights, and keep track of important topics in software development. While working on mobile applications, I frequently encounter new concepts, best practices, and interesting challenges. Writing about them helps solidify my understanding and, hopefully, benefits others in the community as well.

## What You Can Expect

Here, I'll be sharing:

- Deep dives into mobile development (Android & Flutter)
- Notes on best practices, architecture, and performance optimization
- Insights from real-world projects and problem-solving experiences
- Thoughts on industry trends and new technologies
- Personal experiences and lessons learned throughout my career

## Join Me on This Journey

I'm excited to start this blogging journey and would love to connect with others who share the same passion for mobile development. If you find my posts helpful or have any suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Stay tuned for my first technical post soon. ðŸš€
